The Department had appointed a service provider under the National Treasury Transversal contract (LECHOBA MEDICAL TECHNOLOGIES (PTY) LTD) on 
th the 20 March 2020 to deliver PPE to the 
department. The service provider failed to deliver on the promised date and they indicated that there was a delay from their supplier, this delay put the department in a compromising position as its employees Traffic Officers and Volunteers (Patrollers) were exposed to contract the virus and their lives were in danger and this had forced the Department to follow the process of emergency procurement to ensure that necessary PPEs are provided. 
Due to the risk of Traffic Officers and Patrollers being contaminated with the virus an immediate action was required, the department decided to deviate from the normal process of getting three quotation and follow emergency procurement process, which is in line with Treasury Regulations 16A6.4 “If in a specific case it is impractical to invite comparative bids, the Accounting Officer/Accounting Authority may procure the required goods or service by other means, provided that the reasons for deviating from inviting competitive bids must be recorded and approved by the Accounting Officer / Accounting Authority”. 
This deviation is in line with National Treasury Instruction Note number 3 of 2016/17 paragraph 8.1 which states that “the Accounting Officer / Accounting Authority must only deviate from inviting comparative bids in cases of emergency and sole supplier status”. Paragraph 8.2 of the same Instruction note define emergency procurement as “An Emergency procurement may occur when there is a serious and unexpected situation that poses an immediate risk to health, life, property or environment which calls an urgency to action and there is insufficient time to call for competitive bids”.
